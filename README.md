# Footprint

Footprint is a React Native application that enables users to scan food items using computer vision and obtain the corresponding ecological footprint of the product.

## ðŸŒ³ :deciduous_tree: Background and Motivation
We hope that Footprint will empower individuals to make environmentally informed decisions about the food they consume. Our food system contributes over 25% of total greenhouse gas emissions and 80% of global deforestation. So naturally, eating a more ecologically-conscious diet is one of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint. However, specific and accurate information about how to eat an ecologically-conscious diet is difficult to find. Footprint aims to provide detailed and accurate information about food items, while still maintaining a friendly and easy-to-use interface.

## :computer: Tech Stack
Footprint is built with a React Native frontend and a Flask-based Python backend.
